# BankOnIt
Very basic mock up website. My first attempt at learning some basic HTML and CSS. Website is not fully functional, merely for visual pruposes.
CSS is embedded in the HTML files, which definitely isn't the best way to do it, but the purpose of this project was just to learn the basics so I won't bother moving them to separate stylesheets.
Start with welcome.html if you'd like to demo the website.

Inspired by my good friend Brandon Li's business, Zogo (zogofinance.com). Basic idea is a financial services firm with the intention of encouraging financial literacy and good spending habits in teens and pre-teens.
